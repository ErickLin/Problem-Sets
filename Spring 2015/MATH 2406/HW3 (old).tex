If $y \in T(V)$, then $y = T(x)$ for some $x$ in $V$, with $x = c_1 e_1 + \cdots + c_{k + n} e_{k + n}$ for some $c_1, \cdots, c_{k + n} \in \mathbb{R}$. $y$ can be written as
		\[ T(x) = \sum_{i = 1}^{k + n} c_i T(e_i) = \sum_{i = 1}^{k} c_i T(e_i) + \sum_{i = k + 1}^{k + n} c_i T(e_i) = \sum_{i = k + 1}^{k + n} c_i T(e_i) \]
		because elements in the nullspace are mapped to zero.
