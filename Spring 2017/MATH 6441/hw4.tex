    \item[4.]
        \boldmath\textbf{Construct a simply-connected covering space of the space $X \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ that is the union of a sphere and a diameter. Do the same when $X$ is the union of a sphere and a circle intersecting it in two points.
        }\unboldmath \par

        Since $\pi_1(S^2) = 0$, $S^2$ is already a simply-connected covering space of itself. We also know that $\mathbb{R}$ is a simply connected covering space of $S^1$. Thus, the covering spaces in question are given by
        \vspace{4cm}

    \item[12.]
        \boldmath\textbf{Let $a$ and $b$ be generators of $\pi_1(S^1 \lor S^1)$ corresponding to the two $S^1$ summands. Draw a picture of the covering space of $S^1 \lor S^1$ corresponding to the normal subgroup generated by $a^2$, $b^2$, and $(ab)^4$, and prove that this covering space is indeed the correct one.
        }\unboldmath \par
        \vspace{5cm}
        By examining loops, we can see that $a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^4 = 1$ and that these are all the relators. All vertices can be sent to the vertex of $S^1 \lor S^1$ and all edges can be sent to the edge of $S^1 \lor S^1$ sharing the same label in an orientation-preserving manner by a map that is a homeomorphism on the interior of the edge. We can also see that the covering space is normal because it has maximal symmetry.

    \item[18.]
        \sloppy
        \boldmath\textbf{For a path-connected, locally path-connected, and semilocally simply-connected space $X$, call a path-connected covering space $\tilde{X} \to X$ \emph{abelian} if it is normal and has abelian deck transformation group. Show that $X$ has an abelian covering space that is a covering space of every other abelian covering space of $X$, and that such a `universal' abelian covering space is unique up to isomorphism. Describe this covering space explicitly for $X = S^1 \lor S^1$ and $X = S^1 \lor S^1 \lor S^1$.
        }\unboldmath \par
        Consider a path-connected covering space $p : (\tilde{X}, \tilde{x}_0) \to (X, x_0)$ of $X$ in which $H = p_*(\pi_1(\tilde{X}, \tilde{x}_0)) = [\pi_1(X, x_0), \pi_1(X, x_0)]$, the commutator subgroup of $\pi_1(X, x_0)$. Because any commutator subgroup is normal, $\tilde{X}$ is normal and $G(\tilde{X})$ is isomorphic to the abelianization of $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ by Proposition 1.39. Any two such path-connected covering spaces correspond to the same subgroup, which is conjugate to itself because it is normal, and so the covering spaces are isomorphic by Theorem 1.38. \par
        Secondly, $\tilde{X}$ is a covering space of every other abelian covering space because any abelian subgroup of $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is a subgroup of the abelianization. \par
        In the examples, $\pi_1(S^1 \lor S^1) \cong \mathbb{Z} * \mathbb{Z}$, and its abelianization is the free abelian group on two generators, or $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$. One space with this fundamental group is the $2$-dimensional torus. Likewise, $\pi_1(S^1 \lor S^1 \lor S^1) \cong \mathbb{Z} * \mathbb{Z} * \mathbb{Z}$, which has abelianization $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$, and the $3$-dimensional torus has this fundamental group.

    \item[20.]
        \boldmath\textbf{Construct nonnormal covering spaces of the Klein bottle by a Klein bottle and by a torus.
        }\unboldmath \par
        The Klein bottle $K$, a covering space $\tilde{K}$ by a Klein bottle, and a covering space $\tilde{T^2}$ by a torus are given by \par
        \vspace{4cm}
        where edges are identified if and only if they share the same label and subscript. The Klein bottle thus has fundamental group $\pi_1(K) = \langle a, b \mid abab^{-1} \rangle$. \par
        In the first covering space, the conjugacy classes of the subgroup $H_0 = p_*(\pi_1(\tilde{K}, \tilde{x}_0))$ are (from examining loops at basepoints) $H_0 = \langle b, a^3 \rangle$, $H_1 = \langle ba, b^{-1} a \rangle$, and $H_2 = \langle ab, ab^{-1} \rangle$, so $H_0$ is not normal. \par
        Likewise, in the second covering space, the conjugacy classes of the subgroup $H_0 = p_*(\pi_1(\tilde{T^2}), \tilde{x}_0))$ are $H_0 = \langle a, b^2 \rangle$, $H_1 = \langle abab^{-1}, ab^{-1}ab \rangle$, and $H_2 = \langle bab^{-1}a, b^{-1}aba \rangle$, so $H_0$ is not normal.
